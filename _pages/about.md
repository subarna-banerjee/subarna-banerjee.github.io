I am a fourth year PhD candidate at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence. I have also been a non-residential fellow at NCAER's National Data Innovation Centre (NDIC). I hold a BSc. Economics (Hons) from Presidency University, Kolkata, and an MSc. Economics from Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence.


I am in the job market for 2024 - 2025. My research interests lie at the intersection of education, gender, and political economy. I have a keen interest in contributing to empirical evidence that can inform policy interventions that address the complex interactions between educational and political systems and the welfare outcomes of marginalized groups.



Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7mksvdd1ny8l66dnqn5ji/Subarna_updated_CV.pdf?rlkey=7pztvpb3obld3mxgmphvh205d&st=ftroqr4k&dl=0)!
