**Abstract:**  
Launched in 2013 in West Bengal, India, *Kanyashree Prakalpa* is a conditional cash transfer program that incentivizes girls to stay in school and delay marriage. The program provides annual scholarships to 13–18-year-old girls for remaining enrolled in school, and a lump-sum transfer upon attaining adulthood, conditional on remaining unmarried and pursuing education.

Using pre- and post-program data and cohort-specific eligibility rules for 15–35-year-old women, and employing double-difference and triple-difference frameworks, we find that exposed women are 7 to 8 percentage points more likely to experience independent movement outside the home and demonstrate lower tolerance for domestic violence. 

Additionally, the affected cohort shows a 4 to 5 percentage points lower likelihood of justifying wife-beating by husbands. We find suggestive evidence that these results are mediated by access to bank accounts and increased schooling, emphasizing the role of education and financial independence in women’s empowerment.

### 2. Can Media-Reported Sexual Violence Deter Women’s Educational Participation?

**Abstract:**  
This study examines how proximity to media-reported sexual assaults affects women's educational outcomes in India. Combining novel geocoded data on media coverage of sexual crimes with nationally representative micro-data, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the lagged average distance to sexual assaults increases women's schooling by 0.17 years and the likelihood of middle school completion by 1.05 percentage points.

Regions with more access to television, radio, internet, and cellular devices show a stronger response to this effect. The results are also more pronounced in localities with stronger son preferences, a proxy for rigid gender norms. Robustness checks and falsification tests confirm these findings. The study highlights the role of media in influencing the stigma surrounding sexual violence and how it may exacerbate educational underinvestment in girls in conservative societies.

### 3. Under Pressure: High-Stakes Exams and Media-Reported Student Suicides in India

**Abstract:**  
This paper explores the link between high-stakes exam periods and the seasonality of student suicides in India. Using novel, geocoded, high-frequency data on student suicides reported in the media, we analyze the mental health effects of exams such as NEET-UG and JEE-Mains.

Our findings indicate an 18.8% rise in media-reported student suicides during high-stakes exam months. These results hold across various estimation techniques, including Poisson and negative binomial regressions. 

To address concerns about media agenda-setting, we examine subsamples with lower media attention and use cyclone months as exogenous shocks, confirming that the rise in suicides is not driven solely by increased media coverage. Significant regional variations are observed, with more severe effects in states with higher official student suicide statistics. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the economic burden of student suicides due to high-stakes exams amounts to USD 1.17 billion, or 0.057% of India’s real GDP.
