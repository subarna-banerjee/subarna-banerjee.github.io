**Abstract:**  
Launched in 2013 in West Bengal, India, Kanyashree Prakalpa is a conditional cash transfer program incentivizing girls to stay in school and delay marriage. The program provides annual scholarships to 13–18-year-old girls for remaining enrolled in school, and a lump-sum transfer upon attaining adulthood, conditional on remaining unmarried and pursuing education. Using pre- and post-program data and cohort-specific eligibility rules for 15–35-year-old women, and by employing double-differences and triple-difference frameworks, we find that exposed women experience 7 to 8 percentage points higher likelihood of independent movement outside the home and have a lower tolerance for domestic violence. We find the affected cohort to have a 4 to 5 percentage points lower likelihood of justifying wife-beating by husbands. We find suggestive evidence of these results being mediated by access to bank accounts and increased schooling. This underscores the importance of education and financial independence as a pathway to women’s empowerment.

##  Can Media-Reported Sexual Violence Deter Women’s Educational Participation?

*Under Review*

**Abstract:**  
We study the effect of proximity to sexual assault events reported by media on women’s education in India. By combining novel geocoded data on media coverage of sexual crimes with nationally representative micro-data, we find that one standard deviation increase in the lagged average distance to sexual assaults increases the schooling of women by 0.17 years and the chances of middle school completion by 1.05 percentage points. Regions that have more access to television, radio, internet, and cellular devices drive our results. The effect is stronger in localities with higher son preferences, a proxy for gender norms. Our estimates are robust to empirical specifications that remove the effects of reported crimes. The results survive sensitivity and falsification checks. These findings highlight that while mass media can influence the stigma and threat of sexual violence, it can also exacerbate the problem of underinvestment in girls’ education by families in conservative societies.

##  Under Pressure: High-Stakes Exams and Media-Reported Student Suicides in India

**Abstract:**  
We study the association between high-stakes exam months and the seasonality of student suicides in India. Using novel, geocoded, high-frequency data on student suicides reported in the media, we investigate how high-stakes exams like NEET-UG and JEE-Mains can negatively impact youth mental health. Media-reported student suicides rise by 18.8% during high-stakes exam months, with results robust to alternative estimation techniques such as Poisson and negative binomial regressions. We address concerns about media agenda-setting by examining subsamples with lower media attention and using cyclone months as exogenous shocks. The results indicate that the increase in suicides is not solely due to heightened media coverage. Heterogeneous effects are observed across regions, with stronger impacts in states where student suicides are higher according to official statistics. These results withstand sensitivity and falsification checks. Back-of-the-envelope calculations estimate the economic burden of student suicides due to high-stakes exams at USD 1.17 billion, or 0.057% of India's real GDP – a non-trivial figure.

##  From Heaps to Insights: Aadhar's Role in Enhancing Age Data Quality  

**Abstract:**  
I examine the evolution of age data quality in India over the past 30 years using five rounds of nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). My research explores whether the introduction of Aadhaar—a nationwide biometric identification system that serves as proof of identity and simplifies government processes—has played a role in reducing age-heaping, which occurs when individuals are unaware of their exact age and tend to round it to preferred digits. Additionally, I analyze annual reports on state-level Aadhaar coverage to assess its influence on local age-heaping patterns. The results reveal a significant decline in age misreporting in India over time, with a reduced tendency to round ages to multiples of five or even numbers. Moreover, age-heaping at the local level is negatively associated with Aadhaar ownership, and this relationship aligns with state-level variations in Aadhaar coverage. These associations remain robust even after controlling for state- and year-specific unobserved factors and time-varying demographic and economic variables. States with higher Aadhaar saturation, as reported to UIDAI, have experienced a more substantial decline in age-heaping since the system's introduction. Interestingly, this reduction has been particularly pronounced among older individuals, suggesting that the results are not driven by other interventions, such as the push for formal birth registrations, which have mainly affected younger populations in recent years.
